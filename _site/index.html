# Intro

<h1 id="academic-life">Academic Life</h1>
<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>
<p>I began my research journey during my Undergrad at the University of Oxford. I became interested in the fundamental underlying biology of cancers, and how this could be used to target them. I was first able to put this into practice during a placement in the lab of <a href="https://www.cascaleslab.fr/">Professor Eric Cascales</a> in Marseilles, where I worked to produce genetically engineered E. coli capable of targetting and killing colorectal cancer cells. This work was made possible by a <a href="https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/exeter-student-named-laidlaw-scholar-2018/">Laidlaw Scholarship</a> I was awarded.</p>

<!--You can read about my Scholarhsip research here (then put a link to my laidlaw yearbook pdf)
-->

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I am currently studying for a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of York (2020-2023). My PhD concerns the roles of growth factor receptors in bladder cancer and how they interact with tumour differentiation status.</p>

<p>I studied for an Undergraduate and Integrated Masters Degree in Biochemistry (MBiochem), at the University of Oxford (2016-2020), where I obtained an Upper Second Class Degree. My masters research project was based in the Lab of <a href="https://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/ulrike-gruneberg">Professor Ulrike Gruneberg</a>, studying the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, specifically the action of the protein MAD1.</p>
